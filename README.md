# Export
Version control of the MATLAB exporting isotope data codes for the Core Collapse Supernova Nucleosynthesis Visualization project, apart of the larger UT-ORNL CHIMERA collaboration. These Matlab codes are used to export density and abundance information within a simulated progenitor star throughout core-collapse, using thermodynamic trajectories of 4000 Lagrangian mass element particles, and interpolates between these particles based on smoothing radii. My work will be to create a code that chooses optimal smoothing radii for different particles at different timesteps based on alignment, row, and column, as the geometry of the arrangement leaves artifacts and holes when a standard smoothing radius is chosen. Initially, we work to improve the status of the first frame, then plan to move to all the frames, and then compile all images into a movie.
