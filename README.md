# Export
Version control of the MATLAB export data codes for the Nucleosynthesis Visualization Project. Chimera collaboration. These Matlab codes are used to export density and abundance data within a simulated core-collapse supernova progenitor. Initially, we work to improve the status of the first frame, then plan to move to all the frames, and then compile them into a movie.
